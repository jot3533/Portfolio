Doing this project taught use how to communicate with other people to figure out different elements that each other could and other useful skills. This project was a great expirence to hae a feel of how the class was going to progress. For this project My partner, James Sevila, and I recived a B+(88.46%).</p>

                    <p class = "col-md-6">This was the last Python project where we learned how to convert and use PIL and Numpy arrays. This project helped use python code to minipulate and alter image any specific way that we wanted where have a mask on the image or make a black and white. My partner, Rohan, and I chose a client that was a family adn wanted their images to "pop" so what Rohan adn I decided to do was to take the image and make it black and white first, then we made a US flag mask on top of the image. Lastly, We added a 3 color diagonal border to make the image to "pop". After we gave the client tehir altered images they left home happy and we in return recived an A grade on this project. </p>

                            In this project there was a scenario where that 
                            Earth is no longer able to sustain any human life 
                            anymore and there is the constant search for another
                            planet since that the human race can inhabit. Though
                            there is only one planet that was found and there is
                            also just one problem, there is a volcano in the 
                            center of where it is best suitable for the human 
                            race. There was a lot of brainstorming around this 
                            problem and the solution of the city of bridges to 
                            be the best solution out of them all. This will 
                            allow humans to be able to live over the volcano and
                            continue their lifestyle. My group was responsible 
                            for making the Entertainment part of the sector and 
                            this was consisting of many different thing such as 
                            restaurants, movie theaters, and etc. I had created 
                            the restaurant by making one version of the 
                            restaurants and also creating some of the natural 
                            features as well such as the trees and more. This 
                            project was done so that one can use sheet metal in 
                            AutoDesk Inventor to make these parts out of paper 
                            later on as a physical model.

                            skills that were needed for this project. We had 
                            learned Sheet metal to make sure that we are able to
                            create the various flat patterns that were needed 
                            for the folding of the various parts of the world 
                            that were there and needed. In this project we had 
                            made the flat patterns for the various parts of the
                            entertainment sector such as the Movie theater, 
                            resturants, and more. During this porject I had made
                            the two parts of the resturant that was one design 
                            of the resturants that were in our sector and I was 
                            also responsible for making the tree for our sector

The task of this project is to create a themed toy train that will run on a
given straight track to save Lionel Train Company from loss of interest in their
products. Working with my team we had decided to use a Mario Kart theme due to 
the immense popularity and being a iconic theme for many people and children of 
all ages. Given both <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kfMsNuCp33Ib6PUgcld3wsuZ3Lu1FeapyOMG8_cG_TQ/edit">Instructions</a> and <a href = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1euQ7vJcuPhYL_w71SYoZiPL47NLujgtVKRDRu9aPqaQ/edit#slide=id.p4">Design Breif</a>
, our Toy Train contained 4 cars where one car was held responsible 
for each person. The cars that are seen in the pictures are the Head Engine as 
the Mario’s Car, Passenger Car as the Star Car, Storage Car as the Bomb Car, and 
lastly the caboose as the Bullet Bill Car, which I was held responsible for 
creating.

    From this project I was able to enhance my skills of part creation 
    through learning the way to use many different ways to make a part faster and 
    more efficiently. Also learning through experience the importance of File path 
    and management with 3D Modeling and just any file transfer in general. This 
    Knowledge will help me in the future be being able to work on a colloaborate 
    project using Inventor more easily with proper file and transfer, and 
    later on as well I will be able to send my client the proper files as well since 
    it is important that my client has all the files so that they have access to 
    anything and everything that they need to produce their product later on in the 
    future.

We had come up with the Poor Hacker's Almanac. This was a project that twas designed so that the user could be able to search up techincal terms and have a definition that fit their circumstances and how they were using the word/term. This project included the search API of Algolia. Algolia is a indexing search API that is able to have terms given to the user based on the index based on the search that the user has put in. This helped with being able to give the user more accruate results when they are trying to search for a term.</p>
