                    <p>Scratch Project:</p>
                    <p class="col-md-6">This is the very first project that I did in CSE. This project was for the perpose so that all have an even playing feild. Doing this project taught use how to communicate with other people to figure out different elements that each other could and other useful skills. This project was a great expirence to hae a feel of how the class was going to progress. For this project My partner, James Sevila, and I recived a B+(88.46%).</p>

                    <p>MIT App Inventor:</p>
                        <p class="col-md-8">This was the next Project in CSE. This project was similar to the Scratch Project but different becasue there was a much more complex coding environment witha wider array of commands. This project was also to help us communicate with one another and also itroduce use to the intense pressures of this class. For this project my partner and I recived a A-(91.08%)</p>

                    <p>Python Image Minipulation:</p>
                    <p class = "col-md-6">This was the last Python project where we learned how to convert and use PIL and Numpy arrays. This project helped use python code to minipulate and alter image any specific way that we wanted where have a mask on the image or make a black and white. My partner, Rohan, and I chose a client that was a family adn wanted their images to "pop" so what Rohan adn I decided to do was to take the image and make it black and white first, then we made a US flag mask on top of the image. Lastly, We added a 3 color diagonal border to make the image to "pop". After we gave the client tehir altered images they left home happy and we in return recived an A grade on this project. </p>
