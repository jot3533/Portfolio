                            Hello My name is Jotsroop S. Sidhu and I am 
                            currently a sophomore at Dublin High School. 
                            Throughout my time I spend at DHS I would like to 
                            obtain all the skills necessary for me to become a
                            successful Computer Scientist. From my freshman year
                            I was able to acquire all the basic skills that 
                            every computer programmer and scientist has in their
                            tool box, thought I wanted to make that I go ahead 
                            and push myself to accel in this field that deeply 
                            want to purse. During the summer to enhance my 
                            skills with a group of friend we had started a 
                            company where we had team up together and presented 
                            Top of the line companies with our idea on how they 
                            could benefit by implementing a web app that we had 
                            created for them. I had also tried to help give back
                            to my community so I had joined PCATV and will start
                            to give programming classes to my fellow peers and 
                            as well help the organization by creating them their
                            own professional website and web app as well. 
                            I love the Computer Science field of study since 
                            that it allows me to understand and cooperate with 
                            one of my long term enemies, the computer. Through 
                            this I am able to understand how the internet, 
                            computers, websites, and a whole bunch of things 
                            work all together to create what we call today, 
                            the World Wide Web. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Over the course of two years in highschool I have 
                            learned that there is a lot that goes into there 
                            being not only a successful computer programmer but 
                            as an individual as well. Punctual and Reliability 
                            were two important skills that I had learned 
                            throughout my time as a programmer with a summer 
                            organization. Understanding what the task at hand was
                            and when to make sure that the task was done was a 
                            very important skill to learn since that this is used
                            in a number of majors other the computer science such
                            as engineering, and even something totally different 
                            such as fashion design as well. Through participating
                            and winning honorable mention for the Alameda County 
                            Science Fair I learned to make sure that what I need 
                            to finish is done to the best way and accurately.

                            Aside from Computer Programming and Science 
                            related work I also take art in a number of 
                            other activities as well. From these other 
                            activities they have taught me a number of 
                            skills that are interchangeably used throughout 
                            my my daily life. I am part of PCATV, 
                            Punjabi Cultural Association, where I am 
                            responsible for the technology related side of
                            things, and this includes things such as web and
                            app development, listed above, this also 
                            includes creating any digital placement diagrams
                            for any functions that are being planned ways to
                            publicise activities as well. I have also 
                            learned how to be a team member since that we 
                            all work towards a mutual benefit whether that 
                            be planning a particular event or that be 
                            fundraising we all have ideas to contribute and 
                            then we execute those ideas and then gain a 
                            mutual benefit from it. I am also Varsity 
                            athlete as well where from that I had learned 
                            how to self- motivate myself and motivate others
                            as well. Being a team player comes alongside by 
                            playing a sport but it had enhanced this 
                            characteristic in me to wake up and shine.

                            Thought out my time in and out of school 
                            progressing throughout this time learning new 
                            skills about my career in the future and just 
                            characteristics that I have developed throughout
                            . I would like to thank you for your time 
                            reading through this short journey of my high 
                            school career.
